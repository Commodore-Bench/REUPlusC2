PCB_REUSDCRTC_2C5.zip contains all of the Circuit Studio files as well as a copy of the fabrication documents
ReuPlus2CPcbFiles.zip contains the BONM and Gerber files as well as some other output files. These are duplicates of what is in PCB_REUSDCRTC_2C5.zip
REUPlusPcbLibs.zip contains the PCB and SCH libraries used by Circuit Studio

The 2March file contains the PCB libraries, Circuit Studio files, and the manufacturing files in one zip. This seemed like a better idea.
NOTE: there are NO changes to the PCB between this version and the original version.
